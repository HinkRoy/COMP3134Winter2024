What is the definition of server port?
   In the context of computer networking and communications, a server port is a logical endpoint that is used to route and manage network traffic. Each port is identified by a unique number, known as the port number, which helps differentiate between various services or processes running on a single computer. For example, different port numbers are used for different types of services, such as HTTP (port 80) for web traffic, SMTP (port 25) for email, and FTP (port 21) for file transfer. Ports allow a single server with one IP address to provide multiple services simultaneously.


What is server port range?
   The port numbers are divided into ranges based on their intended use. The range for port numbers is from 0 to 65535. This range is subdivided into three categories:

Well-Known Ports: These range from 0 to 1023 and are assigned to common services and applications by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). For example, HTTP is typically on port 80, and HTTPS is on port 443.
Registered Ports: Ranging from 1024 to 49151, these ports are not as strictly controlled and can be used by user processes or applications.
Dynamic or Private Ports: These ports range from 49152 to 65535 and are usually used for client-side communications or temporary purposes.
